Division of Labor:

Amy and I, for the most part, worked together in person on this assignment. We used a github repository to make our updates and additions as seamless as possible. This helped both our work when we were collaborating over the internet as well as in person. We felt it was important to be able to communicate clearly while working through bugs and deciding the future trajectory of the game. We met after I had come up with a proposal and a plot (my other partner dropped the class) to plan the rest of the project. As I had pneumonia for the week before the first check in, Amy did a bulk the the initial coding. After I recovered we began working together on coding, and continued this for the majority of the project. I created a map based on the rooms that Amy sketeched out in the beginning of the project. The bulk of our work was done together. This way, we could both be testing new implementations the other partner made in real time, and point out errors. Though we did also work remotely, using the internet to communicate, this was a much less efficient use of time.
